# PYTHON LIBRARY FOR ANONYMIZATION

This library supports the application of three classical anonymization techniques for tabular data: k-anonymity, l-diversity and t-closeness. 


**Installation**

> We recommend to use Python3 with  virtualenv:
> 
```
> virtualenv .venv -p python3
> source .venv/bin/activate
```


Then run the following command to install the library and all its
requirements:

`pip install python-anonymity`


**Documentation**

> The python-anonymity documentation is hosted on Read the Docs.
